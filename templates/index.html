Scope: Most of the routes and their subsequent functions were inspired 
by the starter code. Connecting to the database was also followed
step by step and other imports on the app.py page.

Originality: We used the following guide provided by the CS 340 staff
for the starter code to this project and built off of it. At the point
we are now, roughly 95% I would consider our own version of the 
starter and really tried to make it custom with the UI styling.

Dates utilized: 09/21/22 - 12/6/22

    <p>Oregon State University is a public land-grant, research university located in Corvallis, Oregon that offers more than 200 undergraduate-degree programs along with a variety of masters and doctoral degrees. Over the recent years due to Covid, there has been a shift in the workforce to promote remote work, leading to more individuals looking to enhance their skills and find jobs that allow greater flexibility and work/life balance. Because of this shift in the workforce, OSU has seen an influx of new students and needs an updated database back-end to track their students, courses, majors, sections, and professors. The average enrollment is greater than 32,000 students at any point throughout the year with nearly 2000 professors and an ever growing list of courses/ majors to accommodate. They are looking to keep a more concise record of the relationships between the entities listed with a database driven website. The focus of the first site roll-out will be OSU undergraduate students, as they represent the largest cohort with an enrollment at around 28,000. </p>
