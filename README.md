## Course Scheduling Web App

The GitHub repository for my course scheduling web app is a full-featured application that allows users to easily manage their course schedules. The app is built using **MySQL** as the database, and it provides full **CRUD** (create, read, update, delete) functionality. This allows users to:

- Add courses to their schedules
- View their current schedule
- Edit existing courses
- Delete courses from their schedules

The app is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to use. Overall, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to manage their course schedules efficiently and effectively.

Below I have a few screenshots of the application for reference.
